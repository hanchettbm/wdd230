                <p>Hick's Law is RT = a + b log2 (n). This basically means that you want to start the page simple and add more as you view.
                   The main point of this page is the download link to this app. This is what you see first, it is simple, and does not
                   overwhelm the user. It is clear what the site is for. But then as you scroll, more descriptions and links follow, following 
                   the ratio.

                <div>
                    <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple Inc</a>

                <p>Apple always uses white in their design. it is quite iconic for them. Here the white space is large, and the new iPhone 
                   shows a pop of color. The white makes the new product stand out. There is also lots of space in between each item making each 
                   product feel important. it also makes the design feel clean. It is not cluttered but simple and modern.

                <div>
                    <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/">HBO Max</a>
                </div>
                <img src="/wdd230//lesson2/images/contrast.jpeg" alt="mobile view screenshot3">
                <p>This is a greatexample of contrast because of the iconic colors. HBO uses the iconic purple color for their background 
                   and logos. But because it is such a vivid color they have to use good contrast so the movies and text on the website is 
                   still readable, and it is. They do a good job of making sure everything is visible but colorful.
